# Skill Subtraction (技能减法)

Check your installed AI skills and cut the fat — a systematic, score-based review of every installed skill with clear keep / archive / uninstall recommendations.

## Why subtraction (核心理念)

Most people keep adding skills — install one, see another, install that too — until dozens pile up and few get real use. Regular subtraction keeps the set lean:

- **认知清爽**：技能越少，选择成本越低
- **资源聚焦**：把精力投入到最有价值的技能上
- **维护省心**：技能需要更新调试，越少负担越轻

## Requirements (运行要求)

| Dependency | Requirement | Notes |
|------|---------|---------|
| Python | 3.10+ | Stdlib only, no third-party deps |
| Runtime | `python3` on PATH | The check script is invoked by this skill |
| Privileges | Non-root | Scan is read-only; uninstall/archive requires user confirmation |
| Platforms | WorkBuddy / Codex / Claude Code / Cursor / Cline / Continue / LobsterAI | Follows the `~/.<agent>/skills/` directory convention |
| Env vars | None | No environment variables required |

## Language auto-detection (语言自动检测)

Never ask the user to select a language upfront. Automatically detect and choose the report language based on the user's input:

- **Chinese input / conversation** → Output Chinese report directly, run script with `--lang zh`
- **English input / conversation** → Output English report directly, run script with `--lang en`
- **Ambiguous / Undetectable input** → Only if the language is truly ambiguous (e.g., pure numbers or code only), ask the user: "中文报告还是英文报告？ / Output in Chinese or English?"

Once determined, stick to that language for all workflow steps (scan, evaluation, report, confirmation).

## Report mode selection (报告模式选择)

Before scanning, determine the report depth independently from the language:

- If the user explicitly asks for a **summary** / **inspection summary** / “检查摘要”, produce an **Inspection Summary / 检查摘要**.
- If the user explicitly asks for a **detailed report** / **full report** / “详细报告” / “完整报告” / “按模板报告”, produce a **Detailed Inspection Report / 详细检查报告**.
- If the user asks only to scan, check, list, or clean up skills without specifying report depth, ask one concise question before scanning: **“需要检查摘要，还是详细检查报告？ / Would you like an inspection summary or a detailed inspection report?”**

An inspection summary is a decision-oriented overview: scope and per-agent counts, major duplicate or batch findings, scan issues, recommendation counts, and the highest-priority actions. It does not need per-skill scoring tables.

A detailed inspection report must follow the matching example exactly in structure: [Chinese template](examples/audit_report_zh.md) for Chinese input or [English template](examples/audit_report_en.md) for English input. Output only that one language version; generate both versions only when the user explicitly requests a bilingual report. Do not replace it with a summary. Include the report mode, scan scope, each skill’s agent/platform placement, recommendation tables, archived inventory immediately after suggested archive, scoring details, and any duplicate or scan issues in the summary; then request cleanup confirmation separately.

## Workflow (工作流程)

### Step 1: Scan installed skills

Run the check script; it auto-detects the hosting agent platform from its own path and scans that platform's installed skills (plus project-level skills in the current workspace). Pass `--lang zh|en` to match the conversation language. For every detailed inspection report, also pass `--archives` so the archived inventory is included:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit_skills.py --lang zh   # or --lang en
python3 scripts/audit_skills.py --agent codex
python3 scripts/audit_skills.py --all
python3 scripts/audit_skills.py --skills-dir "C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\LobsterAI\SKILLs"
python3 scripts/audit_skills.py --archives              # scan the detected agents' archive inventories
python3 scripts/audit_skills.py --archive-dir /path/to/skill-archive
python3 scripts/audit_skills.py --workspace /path/to/workspace
```

Cross-platform notes: the script handles Windows GBK encoding and non-standard `AppData/Roaming/<Agent>/SKILLs` paths. Every failure point logs an issue into the JSON `issues` field and prints a stderr summary. Issue types: `missing_skill_md`, `unreadable_skill_md`, `permission_denied`, `broken_symlink` (error level); `no_frontmatter`, `malformed_frontmatter`, `no_name_field`, `empty_description`, `not_a_directory` (warning level). Exit codes: 0 = clean, 2 = scan done with error-level issues (CI-friendly).

Output includes installed skills plus a separate `archived_skills` inventory; archive records include their archive date, reason, reactivation condition, source path, and integrity indicator. `--archives` checks each detected agent's default `~/.<agent>/skill-archive/`; `--archive-dir` checks a specified archive directory. Archived records are never counted as installed skills or fed into keep/archive/uninstall scoring.

### Step 2: Classify & score

Apply the classification and scoring from the [Evaluation framework](#evaluation-framework-评估框架) section (full detail in `references/evaluation_framework.md` — read it for complex scenarios):

- **6 Functional Domains & Subcategories**: Dev & System / Data & Connectors / Content & Media / Domain & Business / Productivity & Workflow / Meta & Agent Control
- **Install Source** (decoupled dimension): user-installed / platform-preinstalled / agent-created
- **6 weighted metrics** (composite 24–100): usage frequency 25, necessity 20, current relevance 20, enabled status 15, maintenance 10, unique value 10

### Step 3: Recommend

Map the composite score to keep / archive / uninstall using the decision matrix and special rules in the [Evaluation framework](#evaluation-framework-评估框架) section.

### Step 4: Output the selected report mode

Using the language and report mode determined above:

- **Inspection Summary / 检查摘要**: give a compact decision summary. State the scan scope, per-agent counts, distinct-skill count, cross-agent deployments (which are not same-platform duplicates), batch/duplicate findings, scan issues, keep/archive/uninstall counts, and the next action requiring confirmation.
- **Detailed Inspection Report / 详细检查报告**: follow the Chinese template for Chinese input and the English template for English input. Output one language only unless the user explicitly requests a bilingual report. The templates below define its mandatory sections and tables; the examples define the expected complete presentation.

For a detailed report, output only the matching single-language template:

```

Every detailed inspection report must include an **已归档技能库** / **Archived Inventory** section immediately after **建议归档** / **Suggested Archive** and before **卸载** / **Uninstall**, even when no archived skills exist. After executing any archive action in the current workflow, re-scan with `--archives` before issuing the final report. State that the check confirmed the listed records. List the archive date, original archive reason, reactivation condition, and whether the saved record contains `SKILL.md` source. This is an inventory and recovery-readiness check, not a recommendation to reinstall anything.

```

### Step 5: Execute cleanup (user confirmation required)

After outputting the check report, ask the user whether to execute cleanup. **Never uninstall skills without consent.**

- **Execute cleanup**: uninstall (via SkillManage) / archive (save SKILL.md and key config files to `~/.<agent>/skill-archive/<skill-name>.md`, then uninstall) / keep (no action)
- **Report only**: no action, the user decides later

Show each action before executing; proceed only after explicit confirmation. After an archive action succeeds, re-scan the archive inventory and include the confirmed archived record in the final report.

## Inspection cycle recommendations (检查周期建议)

| Frequency | Scenario |
|------|---------|
| Quarterly | When skill count exceeds 10 |
| After each project ends | Clean up project-level skills |
| When business direction shifts | Re-evaluate business-type skills |
| When feeling "too many skills" | Anytime |

## Bundled resources (捆绑资源)

- `scripts/audit_skills.py` — auto-detects the hosting agent platform, scans all installed skills, parses frontmatter, outputs structured JSON
- `scripts/audit_skills.py --archives` — scans default archived-skill records; `--archive-dir` supports a custom archive location
- `references/evaluation_framework.md` — full bilingual framework: classification, 6-metric scoring detail, decision matrix, special rules, dedup priority, archive standard and template. Read it for complex scenarios (batch dedup, archive recovery, platform-preinstalled batch filtering)
- `examples/` — sample check reports (English & Chinese), useful as expected-output references and demo material

## Evaluation framework (评估框架)

> Core scoring tables and decision matrix below for daily use. Full detail (classification, dedup priority, archive standard & template) in `references/evaluation_framework.md` — read it for complex scenarios.

### Six-metric scoring detail (六指标评分细则)

| Metric | Weight | Levels & scores |
|------|------|---------|
| Usage frequency | 25 | high 25 / medium 16 / low 8 / zero 4 |
| Necessity | 20 | irreplaceable 20 / has alternatives 12 / nice-to-have 4 |
| Current relevance | 20 | match 20 / partial 12 / irrelevant 4 |
| Enabled status | 15 | enabled 15 / disabled but recently invoked 9 / disabled & never invoked 3 |
| Maintenance | 10 | active ≤ 30d 10 / normal 30–90d 6 / stagnant > 90d 3 |
| Unique value | 10 | unique 10 / partially unique 6 / complete overlap 3 |

Composite = weighted sum, range 24–100.

### Decision matrix (判定矩阵)

| Score | Recommendation | Description |
|------|------|---------|
| 80–100 | Keep | High-value, master deeply |
| 50–79 | Archive | Save config, uninstall, re-activate when needed |
| 24–49 | Uninstall | Low value, clean up directly |

### Special rules (特殊规则，覆盖评分)

1. Zero usage + irrelevant → uninstall
2. Complete overlap → keep the best one (dedup)
3. Disabled & never invoked → uninstall
4. Project-level + project ended → uninstall
5. Data source defunct → uninstall
6. Platform-preinstalled + batch + no match → batch archive (don't score individually, filter by business direction)
7. Platform-preinstalled + never triggered → archive (not uninstall; may be platform-dependent)
8. Batch detection: ≥ 5 skills created the same day (±1 day) → flag and evaluate as a group

### Dedup & archive details (去重与归档细则)

- **Dedup**: overlapping skills keep only the best one; eliminated ones are marked "uninstall" with "overlaps with X" as the reason. Keep priority: complete → recently updated → high frequency → agent-created → lightweight (see `references/evaluation_framework.md` §4)
- **Archive**: target `~/.<agent>/skill-archive/<skill-name>.md` (see Step 5); full steps and file template in `references/evaluation_framework.md` §5
